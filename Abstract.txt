The idea is to make a website that serves as a database for users to check the status of the COVID-19 situation, the numbers and condition of specific individuals. Amidst this pandemic, a quick way to check such a vital piece of information is essential. The website asks the users to register by giving personal details, and then update the status of whether they have been infected by COVID anytime and then stores the information in a publicly viewable database. Once registered, the users can log in to check the current information and statistics at any point of the day.
